# World Contract

### IWorldDispatcher

You probably have some questions regarding the **IWorldDispatcher** contract that we have been referencing in the Dojo systems above. The **world contract** is a Dojo-defined contract that establishes the world in which the Dojo contracts and models reside. It functions like any other contract, possessing its own interface, implementation, and storage (which will be utilized throughout the project's lifetime). Consequently, just like any other Starknet contract in Cairo, you can import its dispatcher and interface (**IWorldDispatcher**, **IWorldDispatcherTrait**).
