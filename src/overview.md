# Cairo-to-Dojo Docs

Welcome to the Cairo-to-Dojo docs page, where all the more in-depth and technical aspects of adapting Cairo code to the Dojo framework will be discussed and explained for developers looking to use the [Dojo](https://book.dojoengine.org/toolchain/sozo/world-commands/execute) framework to build or improve on-chain contracts in the [Starknet](https://book.starkli.rs/installation) ecosystem. 

Essentially, the 'whys' and 'hows' for specific Cairo and Dojo syntax will be explored, and you can expect anything ranging from developer notes to advanced Cairo topics and feature discussions to be included in this documentation.

This documentation assumes that you have prior knowledge of Blockchain, specifically [Starknet](https://docs.starknet.io/), as well as plenty of experience with its contract language, [Cairo](https://book.cairo-lang.org/ch14-00-building-starknet-smart-contracts.html). 

If you lack familiarity with these topics or need a refresher, we suggest reviewing these helpful resources to get up to speed before proceeding.
